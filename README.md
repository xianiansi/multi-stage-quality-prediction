# multi-stage-quality-prediction
In recent years, the quality prediction methods for multi-stage manufacturing systems (MMS) have gradually shifted from empirical and numerical simulations to data-driven deep learning. However, these methods mainly target single-stage production, and there are still challenges to the accuracy of quality prediction for multi-stage production. </br>

Multi stage quality prediction includes input variables (i.e. detection sources) and output variables (i.e. quality indicators) at different stages.  </br>
